These are generally entirely complete independent systems that have been
brought into the Virality codebase to make packaging, evolution, debugging, and
maintenance of Virality easier. This fundamentally forks them from their
original repos and without the previous history. These libraries were mostly
created for Virality itself, so they innately synchronize well with the
Virality source. In order for these libraries to co-exist with version of the
upstream libraries, system names and packages had to be changed.

When these systems were entailed into Virality, this was the provenance from
whence they came:
