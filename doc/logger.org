* Logger

** Overview

Virality Engine uses a very simple logging system that can be used to display
messages to the screen, at various different log levels. For example, when the
user runs their game with the =:info= log level, only messages of level =:info= and
higher will be displayed, hiding all =:debug= and =:trace= messages that would have
otherwise been shown. The ordered list of log levels is as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(:trace :debug :info :warn :error :fatal)
#+END_SRC

To define a new log message, open the =logging.lisp= file, and copy one of the
existing =slog:define-message= forms, replacing the log level with the desired
level, and a Common Lisp =format= string. This will define a method that will be
called with a variable number of arguments, so feel free to include any argument
substitution =format= directives.

Next, to call this new log message at the desired point in your code, insert the
form: =(slog:emit <name-of-message> arg1 ... argN)=, replacing =<name-of-message>=
with the name you chose in the =slog:define-message=, and passing in any number of
arguments, making sure the number of arguments given matches the argument
substitution directives in the =slog:define-message= form.

You can change the log level the game is executed as by editing the
=data/settings.cfg= file in the user's project, creating it if it does not exist,
and setting the key =:log-level=. An example minimal configuration to execute the
game with the =:trace= level to see every possible message is as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(:log-level :trace)
#+END_SRC
