* Project Maintenance

** Issue Limit

Currently, we allow having up to a maximum of 10 open issues posted. Any more than that requires
fixing and closing existing issues before being added.

** Issue Priority

Issues are assigned to individual developers as another developer sees fit. In addition, issues have
labels applied to them, two of which are =high-priority= and =low-priority=. When a developer wants to
work towards fixing an issue, they should search for an issue to work on in the following order: =is
assigned / high-priority= -> =high-priority= -> =is assigned / low-priority= -> =low-priority= ->
=un-assigned / un-prioritized=.
