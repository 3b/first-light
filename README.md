# first-light

A component based game engine written in Common Lisp for modern OpenGL (4.3+).

NOTE: This engine is still in construction. It notably is missing
collision detections, making it not yet ready for game making. The
developers (psilord and mfiano) hang out in #lispgames on freenode,
and specifically ##hacker-theory on freenode. Stop by if you want to
help or see how to run what we currently have, or just to say hello.

## Overview

Writing a game is a difficult thing. So we've created a system and
work flow that helps you describe the elements needed to write 2d or
3d games. We designed several domain specific languages that make it
easier to describe, manipulate, and use assets commonly found in game
making. Such assets are, but not limited to, textures, materials,
shader programs, and scene trees of actors that are available for
instantiation.

The component system is a hybrid model between an ECS and an object
model.  The components are defined similar to CLOS defclass, and
regular generic methods can be used with them. Components are added to
Actors which represent game concepts like players, scenery, effects,
etc. We define a component protocol invoked by the first-light engine
to move your components to the next state and render them each frame.

## Install

This system is not yet available to be installed automatically with
Quicklisp. To manually install using Quicklisp, clone this repository
into your local-projects directory and issue the following in your
REPL:

```lisp
(ql:quickload :first-light)
```
