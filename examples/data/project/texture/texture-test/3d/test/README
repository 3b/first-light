This testpat 3d texture is a test pattern. It is 8x8x8 worth of data.

Origin is the white dot at back-left-bottom corner.
Green goes from bottom to top.
Blue from back to front.
Red from left to right.

The various other colors are there for examination of rendering.

The mipmaps are generated laboriously by hand. It sucks.
